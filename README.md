## Milestone 4 of the Hackathon: Dynamic Resume Builder with Edit Functionality

I developed a dynamic resume builder using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, which is now enhanced with an edit function. This allows users to create, customize, and update their resumes interactively,  
highlighting my skills in web development and interactive design.
